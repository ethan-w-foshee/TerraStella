# FUNCTIONALITY
- Create a "HIDDEN" id so we can hide certain things.
- Create a way to smelt ore -> metal
- Create a crafting functionality. Simple click and consume items? Or maybe something like a Minecraft crafting Grid? 
- Figure out buildings/skills/resources or something to start the auto functionality (less clicky, more gain-y)
- Figure out a research tree to follow/pursue
- Figure out if we should have a story?


# ART
- ~~Get Abby involved~~ [Abby said she will help!]
- ~~Make Abby get involved~~
- ~~Force Abby to get involved~~
- Sticks n Stones need some Arts!

# RESEARCH
- Make a flow chart maybe of the direction?
- Basic over view, get from earth with sticks and stones, to a dyson sphere? Upon which you can force a "black hole bomb" and prestige?
- Sticks + Stones = Campfire, then campfire + ore = metal?
